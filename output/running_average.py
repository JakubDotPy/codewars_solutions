## Python:

Create a function `running_average()` that returns a callable function object. Update the series with each given value and calculate the current average.

    r_avg = running_average()
    r_avg(10) = 10.0
    r_avg(11) = 10.5
    r_avg(12) = 11
    
All input values are valid. Round to two decimal places.

This Kata is based on a example from Fluent Python book.

## Javascript // Lua // C++:

Create a function `runningAverage()` that returns a callable function object. Update the series with each given value and calculate the current average.

    rAvg = runningAverage();
    rAvg(10) = 10.0;
    rAvg(11) = 10.5;
    rAvg(12) = 11;
