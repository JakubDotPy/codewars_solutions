"""Kata - Pascal's Triangle #2

Here you will create the classic [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle).  
Your function will be passed the depth of the triangle and your code has to return the corresponding Pascal's triangle up to that depth.

The triangle should be returned as a nested array. For example:

    pascal(5) -> [ [1], [1,1], [1,2,1], [1,3,3,1], [1,4,6,4,1] ]

To build the triangle, start with a single `1` at the top, for each number in the next row you just take the two numbers above it and add them together, except for the edges, which are all `1`. e.g.:

          1
        1   1
      1   2   1
    1   3   3   1

### Encodings

`purity: LetRec`  
`numEncoding: BinaryScott`  
export `foldr` for your `List` encoding

### Performance

`20` tests with inputs up to `40`
