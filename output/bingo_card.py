After yet another dispute on their game the Bingo Association decides to change course and automate the game.

Can you help the association by writing a method to create a random Bingo card?

## Bingo Cards

A Bingo card contains 24 unique and random numbers according to this scheme:

* 5 numbers from the B column in the range 1 to 15
* 5 numbers from the I column in the range 16 to 30
* 4 numbers from the N column in the range 31 to 45
* 5 numbers from the G column in the range 46 to 60
* 5 numbers from the O column in the range 61 to 75

## Task

Write the function `get_card()`/`getCard()`.
The card must be returned as an array of Bingo style numbers:

```
[ 'B14', 'B12', 'B5', 'B6', 'B3', 'I28', 'I27', ... ]
```

The numbers must be in the order of their column: B, I, N, G, O. Within the columns the order of the numbers is random.
