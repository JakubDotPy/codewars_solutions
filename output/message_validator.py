"""Kata - Message Validator

In this kata, you have an input string and you should check whether it is a valid message. To decide that, you need to split the string by the numbers, and then compare the numbers with the number of characters in the following substring.

For example `"3hey5hello2hi"` should be split into `3, hey, 5, hello, 2, hi` and the function should return `true`, because `"hey"` is 3 characters, `"hello"` is 5, and `"hi"` is 2; as the numbers and the character counts match, the result is `true`.
      
      
**Notes:**
* Messages are composed of only letters and digits
* Numbers may have multiple digits: e.g. `"4code13hellocodewars"` is a valid message
* Every number must match the number of character in the following substring, otherwise the message is invalid: e.g. `"hello5"` and `"2hi2"` are invalid
* If the message is an empty string, you should return `true`
