"""Kata - My Very Own Python's Split Function

Quite recently it happened to me to join some recruitment interview, where my first task was to write own implementation of built-in split function. It's quite simple, is it not?

However, there were the following conditions:

* the function **cannot** use, in any way, the original `split` or `rsplit` functions,
* the new function **must** be a generator,
* it should behave as the built-in `split`, so it will be tested that way -- think of `split()` and `split('')`


*This Kata will control if the new function is a generator and if it's not using the built-in split method, so you may try to hack it, but let me know if with success, or if something would go wrong!*

Enjoy!
