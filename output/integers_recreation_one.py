`1, 246, 2, 123, 3, 82, 6, 41` are the divisors of number `246`. Squaring these divisors we get: `1, 60516, 4, 15129, 9, 6724, 36, 1681`. The sum of these squares is `84100` which is `290 * 290`.

#### Task
Find all integers between `m` and `n` (m and n integers with 1 <= m <= n) such that the sum of their squared divisors is itself a square. 

We will return an array of subarrays or of tuples (in C an array of Pair) or a string. 
The subarrays (or tuples or Pairs) will have two elements: first the number the squared divisors of which is a square and then the sum of the squared divisors.

#### Example:
```
list_squared(1, 250) --> [[1, 1], [42, 2500], [246, 84100]]
list_squared(42, 250) --> [[42, 2500], [246, 84100]]
```
The form of the examples may change according to the language, see "Sample Tests".

#### Note
In Fortran - as in any other language - the returned string is not permitted to contain any redundant trailing whitespace: you can use dynamically allocated character strings.
