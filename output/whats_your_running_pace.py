"""Kata - What's your running pace?

In this Kata, we will calculate running pace. To do that, we have to know the distance and the time. 

Create the following function:

```if:python
`running_pace(distance, time)`
```
```if:javascript, typescript
`runningPace(distance, time)`
```

Where:
`distance` - A float with the number of kilometres

`time` - A string containing the time it took to travel the distance. It will always be minutes:seconds. For example "25:00" means 25 minutes. You don't have to deal with hours.

The function should return the pace, for example "4:20" means it took 4 minutes and 20 seconds to travel one kilometre.

**Note**: The pace should always return only the number of minutes and seconds. You don't have to convert these into hours. Floor the number of seconds.


"""

def running_pace(distance, time):
    m, s = map(int, time.split(':'))
    s = m * 60 + s
    p = s / distance
    p_m, p_s = int(p // 60), int(p % 60)
    return f'{p_m}:{p_s:02}'
