The [Hamming Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) is a measure of similarity between two strings of equal length. Complete the function so that it returns the number of positions where the input strings do not match. 

### Examples:

```
a = "I like turtles"
b = "I like turkeys"
Result: 3

a = "Hello World"
b = "Hello World"
Result: 0

a = "espresso"
b = "Expresso"
Result: 2
```

You can assume that the two inputs are ASCII strings of equal length.
