"""Kata - Real Password Cracker

### Story

You are a h4ck3r n00b: you "acquired" a bunch of password hashes, and you want to decypher them. Based on the length, you already guessed that they must be SHA-1 hashes. You also know that these are weak passwords: maximum 5 characters long and use only lowercase letters (`a-z`), no other characters.

Happy hacking!

**Notes:**
* pre-generating the full hash table is not advised, due to the time-limit on the CW platform
* there will be only a few tests for 5-letter words *(hint: start from the beginning of the alphabet)*
* if your solution times out, try running it again - the CW runner is sometimes a bit slow(er)
