# Context

The Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit of your country has found a small mine field near your town, and is planning to perform a **controlled detonation** of all of the mines. They have tasked you to write an algorithm that helps them find **all safe spots in the area**, as they want to build a temporal base in the area where all workers can rest safely.

All mines they found are of a special kind, as they only release explosive charge in **four straight lines**, each pointing at a different cardinal point **(north, south, east and west)**. However, the charge stops spreading when it crosses a tree in its path because the charge is not strong enough to burn them.

In the following diagram, ```M``` represents a mine, ```C``` represents the explosive charge released after its detonation, and ```T``` are the trees in the area:

```
. . . . . . .    . . . . . . .
. . . T . . .    . . . T . . .
. . . . . . .    . . . C . . .
. . T M . . . => . . T M C C C
. . . . . . .    . . . C . . .
. . . . . . .    . . . C . . .
. . . T . . .    . . . T . . .
```

# Task

Write an algorithm that, given a mine field represented as an **array of arrays** of size ```M * N```, returns an **array of all safe positions** where workers can build their temporal base. As in the previous model, ```'M'``` represents mines, ```'T'``` represents trees, and ```'.'``` represents empty spaces where explosive charge can spread. The positions in the array **should be in "reading order"** (from left to right, and from up to down).

For example:

```
[
  ['.', '.', '.', '.', 'M'],                      . . . . M                           C C C C M
  ['.', 'M', '.', 'T', '.'],                      . M . T .                           C M C T C
  ['.', '.', 'T', '.', '.'],   ==[represents]=>   . . T . .   ==[after explosion]=>   . C T . C
  ['.', '.', 'M', '.', 'T'],                      . . M . T                           C C M C T
  ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.']                       . . . . .                           . C C . .
]
```
This should return one of the two following arrays, depending on the language. Check sample test cases for more information. Also, **trees don't count as safe positions**.

- ```[(2,0), (2,3), (4,0), (4,3), (4,4)] //For Python```
- ```[[2,0], [2,3], [4,0], [4,3], [4,4]] //For JS and other languages```

Return an empty array if there are no safe positions.

# Note

Mines will not stop explosive charge from spreading as trees do, and explosive charge won't erase mines it finds in its path. **Make sure you never override any mines in the field.**
