Your task is to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes.
The cube at the bottom will have a volume of `$ n^3 $`, the cube above 
will have  volume of `$ (n-1)^3 $` and so on until the top which will have a volume of `$ 1^3 $`.

You are given the total volume m of the building.
Being given m can you find the number n of cubes you will have to build?

The parameter of the function findNb `(find_nb, find-nb, findNb, ...)` will be an integer m
and you have to return the integer n such as `$ n^3 + (n-1)^3 + (n-2)^3 + ... + 1^3 = m $`
if such a n exists or -1 if there is no such n.

#### Examples:

```if-not:nasm
findNb(1071225) --> 45

findNb(91716553919377) --> -1
```

~~~if:nasm
```
mov rdi, 1071225
call find_nb            ; rax <-- 45
    
mov rdi, 91716553919377
call find_nb            ; rax <-- -1
```

"""

def find_nb(m):
    n, v = 1, 0
    while True:
        v += n**3
        if v == m:
            return n
        if v > m:
            return -1
            
        n += 1
