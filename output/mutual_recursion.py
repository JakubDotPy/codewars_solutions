"""Kata - Mutual Recursion

Mutual Recursion allows us to take the fun of regular recursion (where a function calls itself until a terminating condition) and apply it to multiple functions calling each other! 

Let's use the Hofstadter Female and Male sequences to demonstrate this technique. You'll want to create two functions `F` and `M` such that the following equations are true: 

```
F(0) = 1
M(0) = 0
F(n) = n - M(F(n - 1))
M(n) = n - F(M(n - 1))
```

Don't worry about negative numbers, `n` will always be greater than or equal to zero.

You *do* have to worry about performance though, mutual recursion uses up a lot of stack space (and is highly inefficient) so you may have to find a way to make your solution consume less stack space (and time).  Good luck :)
