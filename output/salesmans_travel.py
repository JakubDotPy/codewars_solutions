A traveling salesman has to visit clients. He got each client's address e.g. `"432 Main Long Road St. Louisville OH 43071"` as a list.

The basic zipcode format usually consists of two capital letters followed by a white space and five digits.
The list of clients to visit was given as a string of all addresses, each separated from the others by a comma, e.g. :

`"123 Main Street St. Louisville OH 43071,432 Main Long Road St. Louisville OH 43071,786 High Street Pollocksville NY 56432"`.

To ease his travel he wants to group the list by zipcode.
#### Task
The function `travel` will take two parameters `r` (addresses' list of all clients' as a string) and `zipcode` and returns a string in the following format:

`zipcode:street and town,street and town,.../house number,house number,...` 

The street numbers must be in the same order as the streets where they belong.

If a given zipcode doesn't exist in the list of clients' addresses return `"zipcode:/"`

#### Examples
```
r = "123 Main Street St. Louisville OH 43071,432 Main Long Road St. Louisville OH 43071,786 High Street Pollocksville NY 56432"

travel(r, "OH 43071") --> "OH 43071:Main Street St. Louisville,Main Long Road St. Louisville/123,432"

travel(r, "NY 56432") --> "NY 56432:High Street Pollocksville/786"

travel(r, "NY 5643") --> "NY 5643:/"
```

#### Note for Elixir:
In Elixir the empty addresses' input is an empty *list*, not an empty string.

#### Note: 
You can see a few addresses and zipcodes in the test cases.
