"""Kata - Cat and Mouse - Harder Version

You will be given a string (`x`) featuring a cat `'C'`, a dog `'D'` and a mouse `'m'`. The rest of the string will be made up of `'.'`.

You need to find out if the cat can catch the mouse from its current position. The cat can jump at most (`j`) characters, and cannot jump over the dog.

So:

* if `j` = `5`:

  `..C.....m...D` returns `'Caught!'`  <-- not more than `j` characters between the cat and the mouse

  `.....C............m......D` returns `'Escaped!'`  <-- as there are more than `j` characters between the two, the cat cannot jump far enough

* if `j` = `10`:

  `...m.........C...D` returns `'Caught!'` <-- Cat can jump far enough and jump is not over dog

  `...m....D....C.......` returns `'Protected!'` <-- Cat can jump far enough, but dog is in the way, protecting the mouse

* Finally, if not all three animals are present, return `'boring without all three'`

    jump = abs(c-m) <= j

        return 'Escaped!' if not jump else 'Protected!'
    return 'Caught!' if jump else 'Escaped!'
