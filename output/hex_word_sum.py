"""Kata - Hex Word Sum

### Description
As hex values can include letters `A` through to `F`, certain English words can be spelled out, such as `CAFE`, `BEEF`, or `FACADE`.
This vocabulary can be extended by using numbers to represent other letters, such as `5EAF00D`, or `DEC0DE5`.

Given a string, your task is to return the decimal sum of all words in the string that can be interpreted as such hex values.


### Example

Working with the string `"BAG OF BEES"`:
```
"BAG"  =  0, as it is not a valid hex value  
"OF"   =  0F   =  15
"BEES" =  BEE5 =  48869
```
So the result is the sum of these: 48884 (0 + 15 + 48869)


### Notes
* Inputs are all uppercase and contain no punctuation
* `0` can be substituted for `O`
* `5` can be substituted for `S`
