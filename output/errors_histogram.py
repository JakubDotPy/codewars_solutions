"""Kata - Errors : histogram

In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. The printer uses colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to z (except letters `u`, `w`, `x` or `z` that are for errors).

The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a control string would be `aaabbbbhaijjjm` meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a... and so on.

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a control string is produced e.g. `uuaaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwxym` where errors are reported with letters `u`, `w`, `x` or `z`.

You have to write a function `hist` which given a string will output the errors as a string representing a histogram of the encountered errors.

Format of the output string:

letter (error letters are sorted in alphabetical order) in a field of 2 characters, a white space, number of error for that letter in a field of 6, as many "*" as the number of errors for that letter and "\r" (or "\n" depending on the langauge).

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from `a` to `z`.

#### Examples

```
s="uuaaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwxym"
hist(s) => "u  2     **\rw  5     *****\rx  2     **"
```
*or with dots to see white spaces:*
```
hist(s) => "u..2.....**\rw..5.....*****\rx..2.....**"
s="uuaaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwxymzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
hist(s) => "u..2.....**\rw..5.....*****\rx..2.....**\rz..31....*******************************"
```
#### Notes

- Unfortunately most often Codewars compresses all white spaces into one.
- See other examples in the "Sample tests".
