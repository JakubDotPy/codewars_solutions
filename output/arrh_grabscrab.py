Pirates have notorious difficulty with enunciating. They tend to blur all the letters together and scream at people.

At long last, we need a way to unscramble what these pirates are saying.

Write a function that will accept a jumble of letters as well as a dictionary, and output a list of words that the pirate might have meant.

For example:
```
grabscrab( "ortsp", ["sport", "parrot", "ports", "matey"] )
```

Should return `["sport", "ports"]`.

Return matches in the same order as in the dictionary. Return an empty array if there are no matches.

Good luck!
