"""Kata - Check the status of the generator expression

completed at: 2024-08-19 09:55:02

My third kata, write a function `check_generator` that examines the status of a Python generator expression `gen` and returns `'Created'`, `'Started'` or `'Finished'`. For example:

`gen = (i for i in range(1))` >>> returns `'Created'` (the generator has been initiated)

`gen = (i for i in range(1)); next(gen, None)` >>> returns `'Started'` (the generator has yielded a value)

`gen = (i for i in range(1)); next(gen, None); next(gen, None)` >>> returns `'Finished'` (the generator has been exhuasted)

For an introduction to Python generators, read: https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators.

Please do vote and rank the kata, and provide any feedback.

Hint: you can solve this if you know the right module to use.

        'GEN_CLOSED'   : 'Finished',

    return translate[state]
