"""Kata - k-permutations of n

Implement a function `k_permutations_of_n` that accepts a list of elements `lst` and an integer `k`, and returns all permutations of elements from the list `lst`. Permutations should be a list containing all unique lists of `k` elements from `lst`, in any order.

For example, if `lst == [1,2,3]` and `k == 2` the result should be:

```python
[[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 1], [2, 3], [3, 1], [3, 2]]
```

* if `k > len(lst)` the function should return an empty list, i.e.`[]`
* if `k == 0`, the function should return `[[]]`, because there is exactly `1` way to arrange `0` elements (remember that `0! == 1`).

You can assume that the input list `lst` contains unique elements.
