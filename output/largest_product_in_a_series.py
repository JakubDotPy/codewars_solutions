Complete the `greatestProduct` method so that it'll find the greatest product of five consecutive digits in the given string of digits.

For example: the greatest product of five consecutive digits in the string `"123834539327238239583"` is 3240.

The input string always has more than five digits.

Adapted from Project Euler.
