An array consisting of `0`s and `1`s, also called a binary array, is given as an input.

### Task

Find the length of the longest contiguous subarray which consists of **equal** number of `0`s and `1`s.

### Example

```
s = [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]
         |_____|
            |
         [0,1,1,0]

         length = 4
```

### Note

<!-- this should show the first block for every language except LC -->
```c
0 <= length(array) < 120 000
```
```lambdacalc
0 <= length list <= 25
```
