Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.


### Examples

`[7]` should return `7`, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).  
`[0]` should return `0`, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).  
`[1,1,2]` should return `2`, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).  
`[0,1,0,1,0]` should return `0`, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).  
`[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1]` should return `4`, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).
