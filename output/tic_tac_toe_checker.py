"""Kata - Tic-Tac-Toe Checker

If we were to set up a Tic-Tac-Toe game, we would want to know whether the board's current state is solved, wouldn't we? Our goal is to create a function that will check that for us!

Assume that the board comes in the form of a 3x3 array, where the value is `0` if a spot is empty, `1` if it is an "X", or `2` if it is an "O", like so:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 1, 2],
 [2, 1, 0]]
```

We want our function to return:

* `-1` if the board is not yet finished AND no one has won yet (there are empty spots),
* `1` if "X" won,
* `2` if "O" won,
* `0` if it's a cat's game (i.e. a draw).

You may assume that the board passed in is valid in the context of a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
